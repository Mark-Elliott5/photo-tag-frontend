Site is currently deployed [here](https://search-party.onrender.com).
Monorepo located [here](https://github.com/Mark-Elliott5/photo-tag-app).

This photo-tag-frontend project features:

- Typescript
- A React SPA frontend for an online Where's Waldo game called "Search Party!"
- RESTful API consumption via Axios
- Tailwind
- Vite
- React-flip-toolkit animation

This frontend is to be used with my photo-tag-backend repository. Navigate to the monorepo linked above for more information.

All game logic is held on the backend to prevent cheating. Users are randomly served 5 various "Waldos" from many different franchises to find for a chance to put their name on the leaderboard.
